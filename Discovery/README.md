# Discovery Meeting

## Notes About Accutech
- Accutech develops software solutions for the investment industry, esp. accounting software for trusts and other investments
- Much of Accutech's software deals with sensitive information that must be protected
- Accutech's software products:
  - Cheetah - trust accounting web application
  - Accunet - software that allows a bank's clients to see information about their investments and communicate with the bank

## Context for the Secure SMS Chat Plugin
  - As elderly people pass away, they often leave an inheritance for their family members
  - Accutech wants to appeal to generations of clients, especially middle aged Americans who are likely to recieve an inheritance
  - Banks and their clients need a convenient and secure means of communicating over SMS
- The messaging system will be an API paired with a simple web component that uses the API's features
- Scott Meyer will be our reference for the software specifications
- Trey Gourley will be our reference for technical specifications/issues

## Next Steps
- Meet with Trey the week of Sept. 26th to get specific details about the project
- Research best practices for chat systems
- Look at open source chat systems
