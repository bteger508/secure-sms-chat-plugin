## Iteration 1 Development Documentation
  -- may take some messing with config files to work
  
# Techstack
 - make sure you have installed
  - Docker
  - Docker Desktop (optional if you are comfortable without the ui)
  - AspNetCore / .Net 5
  - node.js
 Visual Studio is preffered as an IDE, but is possible without. (further iterations will ensure an easier development environment)
