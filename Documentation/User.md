# User Documentation

## Getting Started

The secure sms chat plugin allows investors to communicate with their trust officers through a real-time messaging system. This manual shows how to use some of the major features of the software

To register for an account as a trust owner, navigate to http://localhost:8080/Register. Trust officer accounts can be created through the cheetah panel (http://localhost:8080/Cheetah). The register page allows users to enter a username, password, first and last name, and contact information. This system collects this information so it can notify users when they have a new message to read.

### The Accunet Chat Window

Once logged in, trust owners can view a mostly empty window with the option to create a new conversation. Clicking 'Create New Conversation' takes the user to the chat window The first input field is the subject for the conversation. Once the user enters a subject for the conversation, they can send a message to their trust officer. If you press back, you can see a list of conversations you created. Clicking on any of these will take you to the chat for that conversation.
