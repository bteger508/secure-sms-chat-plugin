## Our Experience at the Symposium

Honestly, I was a little disappointed by the symposium. I had hoped more people would come to see the projects and to network. Maybe more people will come next year, though. On the bright side, the experience challenged me to listen to people's questions and to think on my feet. Our team needed to find ways to explain the software to a general audience. This is always harder than it seems. I really do enjoy talking with people and getting to show off my hard work. It was also really enjoyable looking at other people's posters!
