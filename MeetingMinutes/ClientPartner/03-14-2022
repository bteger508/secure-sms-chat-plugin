Feedback from client:
Going in the right direction
Goal is the back and forth conversation between Cheeta and Accunet



Things Clarified:
Ticket system with an email notification would be useful because the company won't have a team who watches the chat
We need to have an item that notifies a Cheeta user that a conversation has started 
We need to have an email sent with the link of the converation
