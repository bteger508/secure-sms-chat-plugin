  - Store messages in database

  - Features for iteration 2 sound good
  - They especially want to see conversation history added and the ability to message specific people
  - Make a plan for how to incorporate the application as a plugin to a website
  

## Things Clarified

- We do not have to decide how the application will fit into accunet, but we should make a mock website to show how the application could be used as a plugin.
