Topics Discussed
Talked through encrypting database and gave us this link: https://emrekizildas.medium.com/encrypt-your-database-columns-with-entityframework-1f129b19bdf8

Do we need to do anything specific to hand the project over

Sendgrid

Sypress

sms and email notification

Documentation feedback


Things Clarified
Encrypting the volume won't be to bad but then you have to get the seeding in which can be difficult
There is a way to add seeds to a formal migration
efcore seed data, loof got migration building that has c data shape object

We should copy our documentation over to bitbucket

They are currently developing a style guide for Vue projects so we should just find an official vue style guide to use

use sengrid for sms alert

don't put sypress in docker container instead run from host machine

be cautios of email and sms notification because it will take longer than we think

Our documentation is looking very good and will be helpful when we turn the project over
