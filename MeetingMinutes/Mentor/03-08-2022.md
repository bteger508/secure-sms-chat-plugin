## Topics Discussed
- We didn't have our new features ready yet, so we focused on questions to help us progress:
  - How to implement JWT Tokens
  - Unit of Work Pattern: refactoring the code to be modular and testable
- Ran out of time to show documentation. Sent the links to Kade for him to look at.

## Things Clarified

- Kade will send feedback over Slack for the documentation.
