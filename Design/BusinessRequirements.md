# Business Requirements

## BR1 Provide a communication channel between banks and their clients such that both parties are confident that their communication cannot be interfered with or intercepted. 


## BR2 Improve relationships with banks' middle aged clients by adopting a modern communication strategy.
In order to keep middle aged clients in the company, Accutech wants a modern communication strategy. As generations of retirement aged Americans pass away, many will leave an inheritance to their middle-aged family members, who are more comfortable with text and instant messaging than phone calls. Accutech hopes that adapting to modern communication channels will improve its relationships with middle-aged Americans.
