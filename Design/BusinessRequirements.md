# Business Requirements

## BR1 Provide a communication channel between banks and their clients such that both parties are confident that their communication cannot be interfered with or intercepted. 
Accutech wants a secure communication line between banks and their clients because this communication contains sensitive financial information. Clients need to know that their credentials and personal information will not be interfered with or intercepted. Accutech hopes to create a communication channel that protects against man in the middle attacks and snooping, giving banks and clients confidence in the confidentiality and integrity of the messages sent.

## BR2 Improve relationships with banks' middle aged clients by adopting a modern communication strategy.
In order to keep middle aged clients in the company, Accutech wants a modern communication strategy. As generations of retirement aged Americans pass away, many will leave an inheritance to their middle-aged family members, who are more comfortable with text and instant messaging than phone calls. Accutech hopes that adapting to modern communication channels will improve its relationships with middle-aged Americans.
